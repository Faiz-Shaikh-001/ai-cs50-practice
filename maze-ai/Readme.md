Maze-AI

Maze-AI is an intelligent pathfinding algorithm that navigates through mazes using AI-driven techniques such as A* Search, BFS, and DFS. This project demonstrates efficient maze-solving strategies and can be extended for various applications, including robotics, game development, and optimization problems.

Features

Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms: A* Search, BFS, DFS.

Configurable Parameters: Adjustable maze size, start and end points, and algorithm selection.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

            python --version

Clone the Repository

            git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-ai.git
            cd maze-ai

Usage

Run the following command to start the application:

    python maze.py maze_file_location.txt  

OR

    python a_alg.py maze_file_location.txt

Example Output

After execution, the AI will find the shortest path in the maze and save the output png in the output folder.
